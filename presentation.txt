PRESENTATION

SECTION 1 - DEMO

Intro

  We won't go through everything

SECTION 2 - WALK THROUGH CODE

  BARRY explain order model
  THOMAS - Cleanest architecture
    Quality of the seed file
    the orders seed function makes sure the data in the table is properly constrained by our rules
    THOMAS - Best test
  JON - proud of popups. proud of route security
  JON - most technical debt is in the index.js in server/auth for combining carts

SECTION 3 - SINGLE SMALL FEATURE
  Password reset for users

SECTION 4 - HIGH LEVEL TAKEAWAYS
  Success
    Stand ups great for delegation
    refactoring components

  Collaboration
    Barry and Jon did a lot of unnecessary bikeshedding at beginning
    Premature optimization
    Should have waited to have some of those disccussions
      Example: getters and setters on prices
      Jon "won" and Barry wrote them, but then jon forgot to use them...

    Overcorrect

  Architecture
    Planned out the DB, but never planned API routes or strucutre of the redux store
    Lack of correct mapping between the API routes, redux store, and front end routes

  Investments that paid off
    Seed file & test specs
    Models
    Popup

  Overplanned
    Jonathan on the stars :)
